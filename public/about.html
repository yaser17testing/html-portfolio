<h1>About Me</h1>




<p>I am a student who has recently graduated as a software tester and now aiming to graduate as a web developer/system developer. Currently, I am taking a course on Udemy to become a web developer as a preparation for my upcoming education. Additionally, in my free time, I study Java programming. My ultimate goal with all this knowledge I am acquiring is to become a full-stack developer or simply an expert in the IT industry, while also diversifying my skills within the field.</p>
